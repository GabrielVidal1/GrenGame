  - plantName: Fern
    plantLatinName: Pteridium aquilinum
    plantDescription: Pteridium aquilinum (bracken, brake or common bracken), also
      known as eagle fern, and Eastern brakenfern, is a species of fern occurring
      in temperate and subtropical regions in both hemispheres. The extreme lightness
      of its spores has led to its global distribution.  Common bracken was first
      described as Pteris aquilina by Carl Linnaeus, in Volume 2 of his Species Plantarum
      in 1753. The origin of the specific epithet derived from the Latin aquila "eagle".
      In the reprint of the Flora Suecica in 1755, Linnaeus explains that the name
      refers to the image of an eagle seen in the transverse section of the root.
      In spite of this, the opinion has been forwarded that the name pertains to the
      shape of the mature fronds appearing akin to an eagle's wing. However, medieval
      scholars, including Erasmus, thought the pattern of the fibres seen in a transverse
      section of the stipe resembled a double-headed eagle or oak tree. It was placed
      in the genus Pteridium by Friedrich Adalbert Maximilian Kuhn in 1879.

  - plantName: Common Lime
    plantLatinName: Tilia x europaea
    plantDescription: "Tilia \xD7 europaea, generally known as the common lime (British
      Isles) or common linden (North America), is a naturally occurring hybrid between
      Tilia cordata (small-leaved lime) and Tilia platyphyllos (large-leaved lime).
      It occurs in the wild in Europe at scattered localities wherever the two parent
      species are both native. It is not closely related to the lime fruit tree, a
      species of citrus."

  - plantName: Ivy
    plantLatinName: Hedera canariensis
    plantDescription: "It is an evergreen perennial climbing or trailing woody plant
      shrub or bush, growing to 20\u201330 m high where suitable surfaces (trees,
      cliffs, walls) are available, and also growing as ground cover where there are
      no vertical surfaces. It climbs by means of aerial rootlets which cling to the
      substrate. In warm climates, it grows more rapidly and becomes established faster
      than the related H. hibernica, and H. helix. It is endemic to the Canary islands
      where it is quite common especially in Laurel forest of Barbusano."

  - plantName: Bramble
    plantLatinName: Rubus armeniacus
    plantDescription: "Rubus armeniacus, the Himalayan blackberry or Armenian blackberry,
      is a species of Rubus in the blackberry group Rubus subgenus Rubus series Discolores
      (P.J. M\xFCll.) Focke. It is native to Armenia and Northern Iran, and widely
      naturalised elsewhere. Both its scientific name and origin have been the subject
      of much confusion, with much of the literature referring to it as either Rubus
      procerus or Rubus discolor, and often mistakenly citing its origin as western
      European. Flora of North America, published in 2014, considers the taxonomy
      unsettled, and tentatively uses the older name Rubus bifrons."

  - plantName: Bamboo
    plantLatinName: 'Acidosasa venusta '
    plantDescription: The bamboos are evergreen perennial flowering plants in the
      subfamily Bambusoideae of the grass family Poaceae. In bamboo, as in other grasses,
      the internodal regions of the stem are usually hollow and the vascular bundles
      in the cross section are scattered throughout the stem instead of in a cylindrical
      arrangement. The dicotyledonous woody xylem is also absent. The absence of secondary
      growth wood causes the stems of monocots, including the palms and large bamboos,
      to be columnar rather than tapering.

    plantLatinName: Agaricaceae Allopsalliota
    plantDescription: Allopsalliota is a fungal genus in the family Agaricaceae. A
      monotypic genus, it consists of the single species Allopsalliota geesterani,
      found in the Netherlands. The specific epithet honors Dutch mycologist Rudolph
      Arnold Maas Geesteranus. Allopsalliota was circumscribed in 1998 to contain
      what was then known as Agaricus geesterani, a species first described in 1986
      by Cornelis Bas and Paul Heinemann.

    plantLatinName: Rosa rugosa
    plantDescription: Rosa rugosa (rugosa rose, beach rose, Japanese rose, or Ramanas
      rose) is a species of rose native to eastern Asia, in northeastern China, Japan,
      Korea and southeastern Siberia, where it grows on the coast, often on sand dunes.
      It should not be confused with Rosa multiflora, which is also known as "Japanese
      rose". The Latin word "rugosa" means "wrinkled."

    plantDescription: Ismelia carinata, the tricolour chrysanthemum, tricolor daisy,
      or annual chrysanthemum, is an ornamental plant native to north Africa that
      is cultivated as a garden plant and grows as a weed in California. It is the
      sole species in the genus Ismelia.

      m). The smooth bark is chestnut-brown, with prominent horizontal lenticels.
      The leaves are arranged alternately, simple, ovate-lanceolate, 5\u201313 cm
      long and 2.5\u20136.5 cm broad, with a short petiole and a serrate or doubly
      serrate margin. At the end of autumn, the green leaves turn yellow, red or crimson."

  - plantName: Fairy Ring
    plantLatinName: 
    plantDescription: A fairy ring, also known as fairy circle, elf circle, elf ring
      or pixie ring, is a naturally occurring ring or arc of mushrooms. The rings
      may grow to over 10 metres (33 ft) in diameter, and they become stable over
      time as the fungus grows and seeks food underground. They are found mainly in
      forested areas, but also appear in grasslands or rangelands. Fairy rings are
      detectable by sporocarps in rings or arcs, as well as by a necrotic zone (dead
      grass), or a ring of dark green grass. Fungus mycelium is present in the ring
      or arc underneath.

      to Africa, and forms tall stands of reed-like swamp vegetation in shallow water.
      \ Papyrus sedge (and its close relatives) has a very long history of use by
      humans, notably by the Ancient Egyptians\u2014it is the source of papyrus paper,
      one of the first types of paper ever made. Parts of the plant can be eaten,
      and the highly buoyant stems can be made into boats. It is now often cultivated
      as an ornamental plant.  In nature, it grows in full sun, in flooded swamps,
      and on lake margins throughout Africa, Madagascar, and the Mediterranean countries."

      component of the coastal sage scrub plant community, and is a part of drought-adapted
      chaparral and mixed oak woodland habitats. It is also known by the common names
      Christmas berry and California holly. Accordingly, "the abundance of this species
      in the hills above Los Angeles gave rise to the name Hollywood."

  - plantName: Boletus
    plantLatinName: Boletus edulis
    plantDescription: Boletus is a genus of mushroom-producing fungi, comprising over
      100 species. The genus Boletus was originally broadly defined and described
      by Carl Linnaeus in 1753, essentially containing all fungi with pores. Since
      then, other genera have been defined gradually, such as Tylopilus by Petter
      Adolf Karsten in 1881, and old names such as Leccinum have been resurrected
      or redefined. Some mushrooms listed in older books as members of the genus have
      now been placed in separate genera. These include such as Boletus scaber, now
      Leccinum scabrum, Tylopilus felleus, Chalciporus piperatus and Suillus luteus.
      More recently, Boletus has been found to be massively polyphyletic, with only
      a small percentage of the over 300 species that have been assigned to Boletus
      actually belonging there and necessitating the description and resurrection
      of many more genera.
